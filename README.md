# address-book-mobile
A mobile application that provides a telephone directory


## General structure

* **Home Page**

* **Add Page**

* **Edit Page**



## What can the application do?

1) The mobile application presents a __list of contacts__ name-surname and telephone number.

```
fisrName lastName phoneNumber
```

2) __Contacts can be filtered__ through a search bar at the top.

3) By clicking on a contact we can __view the details__.

4) From the homepage we can __add a contact__ using the appropriate Add button.

5) The Add form has 4 fields on which __validations__ are present. If we insert empty name and surname the app will not insert the contact. Another check is performed on the telephone number, which must be in the form ```+39 00 1234567``` ( if the phone number does not respect this pattern an error message is displayed).

6) In the Form Add there are two buttons one to __save the contact__ ("Save") and a button to cancel the operation ("Cancel").

7) You can also __edit the contact__ using the Edit button in the detail directoy. The functionality works similarly to the Add function.
