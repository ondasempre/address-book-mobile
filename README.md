# address-book-mobile
A mobile application that provides a telephone directory


## General structure

* **Home Page**

* **Add Page**

* **Edit Page**



## What can the application do?

1) The mobile application presents a list of contacts name-surname and telephone number.

```
fisrName lastName phoneNumber
```

2) Contacts can be filtered through a search bar at the top.

3) By clicking on a contact we can view the details.

4) From the homepage we can add a contact using the appropriate Add button.

5) The Add form has 4 fields on which validations are present. if we insert empty name and surname the app will not insert the contact. Another check is performed on the telephone number, which must be in the form ```+39 00 1234567``` ( if the phone number does not respect this pattern an error message is displayed).

6) In the Form Add there are two buttons one to save the contact ("Save") and a button to cancel the operation ("Cancel").

7) You can also edit the contact using the Edit button in the detail directoy. The functionality works similarly to the Add function.
